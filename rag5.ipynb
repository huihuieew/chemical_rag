Enantioen-\\nriched 2-substituted pyridines, which are frequently encoun-tered in natural products and pharmaceuticals, could be easilyconstructed by this simple method in good yields and excellentenantioselectivity. The synthetic utility of the pyridine productsis demonstrated through the synthesis of a key intermediate of\\na reported Na\\n+/H+exchanger inhibitor and the total synthesis\\nof (/C0)-lycopladine A.\\nPyridines are among the most prevalent heterocyclic\\nstructural moieties in biologically active natural products,pharmaceuticals, and agrochemicals.\\n[1]For example, twelve\\nsmall molecules containing a pyridine motif were listed in the\\ntop 200 pharmaceutical products in 2012, including the top\\nentry, Nexium.[2]Therefore, diverse functionalization of\\npyridine derivatives could lead to wide applications in manyfields.\\n[3]One aspect of our ongoing efforts to develop methods\\nto build complex and biologically active molecules is theapplication of iridium-catalyzed allylic substitution reactions\\nwith heteroaromatic compounds as nucleophiles.\\n[4]\\nIridium-catalyzed enantioselective allylic substitution\\nreactions have become a powerful tool for constructingcarbon–heteroatom and carbon–carbon bonds, and they havefound extensive application in the total synthesis of naturalproducts and the preparation of bioactive compounds.\\n[5]\\nAlthough a wide range of nucleophiles can be employed inthese reactions, unstabilized carbon-type nucleophiles havebeen much less studied and have been mainly limited toenolates, organoborons, and aryl- or alkylzinc bromides\\n[6]\\nowing to challenges relating to reactivity and controlling theregio- and enantioselectivity. The exploration of unstabilizednucleophiles in iridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitu-\\ntion is thus still of great importance.\\nRecently, transition-metal-catalyzed allylic alkylation\\nreactions of unstabilized benzylic nucleophiles have attractedinterest because of their applications in the synthesis of\\na broad diversity of complex molecules.\\n[7]Pioneering works\\nfrom the groups of Trost[7a]and Walsh[7h]have led to\\nimpressive palladium-catalyzed processes for asymmetricallylic alkylation with 2-methylpyridine derivatives (p K\\na\\n/C2534[8a]) and toluene derivatives (p Ka/C2544[8b]), respectively.\\nIn these studies, elegant strategies have been developed thatinvolve the addition of activating agents to stabilize the\\nresulting anionic charge. To date, there are only a few\\nexamples of these reactions in a catalytic asymmetric version,and the reaction scope is very limited. Inspired by thesestudies, we envisaged that the alkyl nucleophiles generatedin situ from 2-methylpyridines might be compatible withiridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions.Under iridium catalysis, complementary selectivity and sub-\\nstrate scope would facilitate the utility of the methods in the\\nsynthesis of natural products and bioactive molecules(Figure 1).\\n[9]Herein, we describe the first iridium-catalyzed\\nasymmetric allylic substitution reaction with highly unstabi-lized alkyl nucleophiles derived in situ from 2-methylpyri-dines.\\nWe began our study by testing the reaction of tert-butyl\\ncinnamyl carbonate with the complex generated in situ from2-methylpyridine and BF\\n3·OEt2with different ligands\\n(Table 1). It is proposed that BF3·OEt2coordinates to\\npyridine nitrogen to increase the acidity of the proton of the\\nmethyl group and stabilize the resulting carboanion. The\\nFeringa ligand and its variants ( L1,L2,L3, and L4) afforded\\nthe desired product in varied yields and enantioselectivity. Toour delight, the Alexakis ligand L2gave 3ain 71% yield and\\n95% ee. The reactions with L5orL6only led to a trace\\namount of product. The reaction outcomes of ligands L7,L8,\\nand L9were unsatisfactory, and only L7, which contains\\na methoxy group, afforded 3ain 27% yield and 84% ee.\\nFurther optimization of the reaction conditions revealed thatLiHMDS is the optimal base, but multiple equivalents\\nFigure 1.

Next, solvents\\nwere surveyed and THF was found to be the optimal one (seethe Supporting Information for details). To simplify theoperational procedure, the iridium complex K1\\n[10](8 mol%),\\nprepared from the optimal ligand L2, was used directly. The\\nreaction gave a similar yield with an increased enantioselec-tivity (97% ee). To our delight, it was found that 71% yield\\nwas obtained in the presence of 6 mol% catalyst without any\\neffect on enantioselectivity. However, the reaction did notproceed to full conversion when 4 mol% of K1was used.\\nBased on these results, the optimal reaction conditions wereestablished as described in Table 1, entry 11.\\nWith the optimal reaction conditions in hand, we under-\\ntook studies on the scope and limitations of the allylic\\nalkylation reaction. As depicted in Table 2, with 1aas the\\nnucleophile, allyl carbonates containing 4-MeO, 4-Me, 4-F, 3-MeO, and 3-Me substituents on the phenyl ring wereexamined and were found to be well tolerated, deliveringthe corresponding products efficiently ( 3b,3c,3d,3g,3h, 71–\\n90% yields, 96–98% ee). Although substrates bearing 4-Cl or\\n4-Br were less reactive, reactions in the presence of 8 mol%\\nof the catalyst delivered the products in moderate yields withexcellent enantioselectivity ( 3e,3f, 76–78% yields, 97% ee).Excellent enantioselectivity was obtained for substrates\\nbearing 3-Br or 3-Cl substituents ( 3i,3j, 52–60% yields,\\n96% ee). However, the reaction with tert-butyl crotyl\\ncarbonate occurred to give only trace amounts of product\\nwith a low branch-to-linear ratio. These results suggest that\\nthe reaction with the unstabilized carbon nucleophiles is moresensitive to the electronic and steric properties of the allylcarbonates compared to reactions with soft carbon nucleo-philes. To our delight, heteroaryl allylic carbonates, such asthose derived from 2-thienyl and 3-indolyl, were compatible\\nunder the optimized conditions ( 3l,3m, 69–71% yields, 96–\\n98% ee).\\nSubsequently, we set out to investigate the scope with\\nrespect to the nucleophiles. A variety of 2-methylpyridineswith diverse substituents were examined (Table 3). Alkyl orphenyl substituents at the 3-, 4-, or 5-positions of pyridinewere tolerated, delivering the desired products smoothly ( 4a–\\nc,4h–j, 70–94% yields, 95–98% ee). It is worth noting that\\nvinyl and alkynyl groups were also well tolerated ( 4f,4g, 65–\\n87% yields, 96–97% ee). Gratifyingly, the allylation reactions\\nof 2-methyl pyridines bearing a bromide group at the 3- or 5-position occurred smoothly to give products in excellentenantioselectivity ( 4d,4e, 97–98% ee).\\nTo demonstrate the utility of the current method, it was\\napplied in the synthesis of biologically interesting compoundsand natural products. Product 4gwas converted into the\\ncorresponding olefin compound through ring-closing meta-thesis (RCM). Hydroboration and oxidation yielded thecorresponding alcohol, and oxidation with MnO\\n2then\\ngenerated the key intermediate 6with high enantiopurity.\\nThe latter compound can be converted into a previously\\ndescribed Na+/H+exchanger inhibitor by following the\\nreported procedure (Scheme 1).[9a]Table 1: Optimization of the reaction conditions.[a]\\nEntry L Yield [%][b]ee[%][c]\\n1 L1 23 84\\n2 L2 71 95\\n3 L3 20 80\\n4 L4 42 /C077\\n5 L5 trace –\\n6 L6 trace –\\n7 L7 27 84\\n8 L8 trace –\\n9 L9 trace –\\n10[d]L2 73 97\\n11[e]L2 71 97\\n12[f]L2 54 97\\n[a] Reaction conditions: [Ir(cod)Cl]2(4 mol%), L(8 mol%), 1a\\n(0.3 mmol), 2a(0.2 mmol), BF3·Et2O (0.26 mmol) and LiHMDS (0.7 mL,\\n1min THF) in THF (2 mL) at 30 8C.

It shows modestbut selective cytotoxicity toward murine lymphoma L1210cells (IC\\n50=7mgmL/C01).[7c,9c]The unusual structure and inter-\\nesting biological activity of lycopladine A have aroused theinterest of several synthetic groups, which has led to\\nsuccessful total syntheses by Toste, Martin, Hiroya, Yang\\nand Meng.\\n[12]Our synthesis of lycopladine A by the current\\nmethod is summarized in Scheme 2.

ThisC−N bond forming process readily accommodates a diverse\\nrange of amines and allylic carbonates, especially for thepreviously challenging ortho-substituted cinnamyl substrates.Moreover, isolation and characterization of the corresponding(π-allyl)−iridium complex K1reveal that the active iridacycle is\\ngenerated through a C(sp\\n2)−H bond insertion of tetrahydroquinoline of the ligand.\\n■INTRODUCTION\\nIridium-catalyzed asymmetric allylic substitution reactions have\\nbecome a powerful tool to construct chiral centers in organic\\nsynthesis.1A literature survey shows that many catalytic\\nsystems involving chiral ligands such as oxazolinyl-phosphine\\nligands,1hbinaphthol-derived phosphoramidites,2phosphora-\\nmidite-ole ﬁn ligands,3and others4have been successfully\\ndemonstrated in this transformation.\\nIn particular, Ir complexes derived from Feringa type ligands\\nusually provide excellent regio- and enantioselectivity for a\\nvariety of substrates.5Subsequent mechanistic studies by the\\nHartwig group and the Helmchen group reveal that the active\\niridacycle catalyst is generated by cyclometalation of a methyl\\ngroup of the ligand ( Figures 1 and 2a).6Although the\\n[Ir(COD)Cl]2/1acombination is widely appreciated for its\\nreactivity and selectivity, its sensitivity to steric hindrance\\nsomehow limits its application. For example, ortho-substituted\\nphenyl allylic substrates were found to lead to a decrease in\\neither yield or enantioselectivity in many cases ( Scheme 1 ).7\\nRecently, our group has developed a series of N-aryl\\nphosphoramidite ligands, which o ﬀer high regio- and\\nenantioselective control with a broad substrate scope involvingsterically congested nucleophiles.8Moreover, these types of\\nligands were found to be superior to previously establishedsystems in asymmetric allylic alkylation of ortho-substitutedcinnamyl carbonates.\\n8a,bOne possibility for the high reactivity\\nwith sterically bulky substrates has been rationalized by the factthat the iridacycle catalyst, formed through C(sp\\n2)−H\\nReceived: April 26, 2016\\nFigure 1.

To our surprise, the\\ncorresponding regioselectivity (branched to linear) decreased\\ndramatically from 99/1 to 83/17. The C3 terminus of the allylfragment of Kb(Figure 2 b) is more electrophilic than the C1\\nterminus, which principally drives the branched selectivity as wereported previously.\\n9However, by comparing the CPK models\\n(Figure 2 ), we found that the C1 terminus of Kbis much less\\nsterically surrounded than that of Ka. Thus, for the small but\\nhighly reactive nucleophiles (i.e., amines), although thebranched product is still the major outcome, there are increasedchances to attack the C1 terminus to form a linear product. We\\nsought to improve the regioselectivity by engineering new\\nligands to create a crowded environment close by the C1terminus in order to prevent it from being attacked. With theseideas in mind, several new N-aryl phosphoramidite ligands\\n(1c−g), designed by the installment of substituents at the 3,3 ′-\\npositions of the BINOL sca ﬀold or increase in the size of the 2-\\nsubstituent of tetrahydroquin oline, were synthesized andapplied in the allylic amination reactions. We herein wish to\\nreport the results from this study.\\n■RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\\nOptimization of the Reaction Conditions. We next\\ninvestigated the e ﬃciency of these N-aryl phosphoramidite\\nligands10in iridium-catalyzed allylic amination reactions ( Table\\n1). The 2-phenyl-substituted ligand 1cled to a slightly\\nincreased regioselectivity, but a decreased enantioselectivity(entry 3). To our delight, ligand 1d,8iby introducing double\\nphenyl substituents at the 3,3 ′-positions of BINOL, was found\\nto be able to improve the branched selectivity dramatically (99/1), meanwhile maintaining the excellent enantioselectivity(97% ee, entry 4). In comparison, linear product was formedfavorably when 3,3 ′-dibromo-substituted binaphthol derived\\nligand 1ewas used ( 4a/5a/6a= 22/78/0, entry 5). A sharp\\ndecrease in the enantioselectivity (55% ee) was observed whenligand 1fwithout a methyl group in the amine part was\\nemployed (entry 6). Interestingly, employment of ligand 1g,a\\ndiastereomer of 1dwith an opposite con ﬁguration in the amine\\npart, provided results in terms of selectivity and yield identicalwith those of the reaction with 1d(entry 4 vs entry 7). Given\\nthe same reactivity and selectivity of the catalysts derived from\\n1dand1g, we envisioned that it was not necessrary for the 2-\\nmethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline to be enantiopure in thiscase. Further evidence was obtained by the use of acombination of [Ir(COD)Cl]\\n2with a mixture of identical\\namounts of 1dand 1g,aﬀording the same yields and\\nselectivities as expected ( 4a/5a/6a= 99/1/0, 88% yield, 97%\\nee, entry 8). Since the mixture of diastereomers is easilyaccessed from readily available enantiopure BINOL andracemic 2-methyltetrahydroquinoline directly, the utilizationof this diastereomeric ligand mixture will provide an economicalternative for ligand 1dor1g, especially for scale-up reactions.\\nSubstrate Scope. With the optimized reaction conditions\\nin hand, our e ﬀorts were focused on expanding the reaction\\nsubstrate scope by exploring va rious nitrogen-containing\\nnucleophiles and ortho-substituted phenyl allylic carbonates(Scheme 2 ). The results obtained with 1aas ligand for\\ncomparison were adhered to (highlighted in blue). First, withaniline as the nucleophile, the cinnamyl carbonate with anelectron-donating methyl group at the ortho position wastested ( 1das the ligand), a ﬀording the desired product 4bin\\ngood yield and excellent enantioselectivity (80% yield, 93% ee).In sharp contrast, only a moderate ee was obtained when 1a\\nwas employed as the ligand (58% yield, 39% ee, 4b;Scheme 2 ).\\nIt is worth noting that the reaction of 2-bromocinnamyl ethylcarbonate with aniline catalyzed by the chiral Ir complexderived from [Ir(COD)Cl]\\n2and ( R,R,Ra)-1aform product 4c\\nin 26% yield and 29% ee.7iPleasingly, with a catalyst derived\\nfrom [Ir(COD)Cl]2and ligand 1d, 2-bromocinnamyl methyl\\ncarbonate was converted to its amination product 4cin 86%\\nyield and 96% ee. Moreover, non-ortho-substituted substratesincluding heteroaryl allyl carbonate and para-substitutedcinnamyl carbonates proceeded smoothly, with ligand 1d\\nyielding 4d−fwith satisfactory results (79 −85% yields, 86 −\\n90% ee) in comparison with those obtained from ligand 1a\\n(74−84% yields, 88 −93% ee; Scheme 2 ), showcasing the\\ngenerality of the current catalytic system.\\nTo further test the potential of this Ir-catalyzed allylic\\namination reactions, we turned our attention toward othernucleophiles such as indoline due to its prevalence in naturalproducts ( 4g−k,Scheme 2 ).

In aﬂame-dried Schlenk tube were placed a solution\\nof [Ir(COD)Cl]2(203.8 mg, 0.3 mmol) and ligand 1d(378.9 mg, 0.6\\nmmol) in dry THF (20 mL) under an argon atmosphere. After the\\nmixture was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, AgOTf (157.6\\nmg, 0.6 mmol) and allyl methyl carbonate (168.8 mg, 1.5 mmol) wereadded subsequently, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight to\\naﬀord a pale suspension. The precipitate was ﬁltered, and the solvents\\nwere removed under reduced pressure. The residue was washed with\\ndiethyl ether (10 mL ×3) to give ( π-allyl)−Ir complex K1(284.8 mg,\\n85%) as a pale yellow powder, existing as two isomers in a ratio of 92/8 as determined by\\n31P NMR.\\nFull details can be found in the Supporting Information .■ASSOCIATED CONTENT\\n*SSupporting Information\\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge on the\\nACS Publications website at DOI: 10.1021/acs.organo-\\nmet.6b00339 .\\nExperimental procedures and analysis data for all new\\ncompounds ( PDF)\\nCrystallographic data ( CIF)\\n■AUTHOR INFORMATION\\nCorresponding Author\\n*E-mail for S.-L.Y.: slyou@sioc.ac.cn .\\nNotes\\nThe authors declare no competing ﬁnancial interest.■ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank the National Basic Research Program of China\\n(2016YFA0202900, 2015CB856600), the National NaturalScience Foundation of China (21332009, 21421091,21572252), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences for generousﬁnancial support.\\n■REFERENCES\\n(1) For selected reviews, see: (a) Helmchen, G.; Dahnz, A.; Du ̈bon,\\nP.; Schelwies, M.; Weihofen, R.

Studies by Hartwig et al. revealed that the\\nregioselectivity of the substitution process is usually high when the\\ndiﬀerence in Ir −C bond lengths is greater than 0.07 Å; see ref 7ifor\\ndetails. Recent computational studies suggested that interactions of H-bond acceptors with a vinyl C −H bond of the alkene ligand may\\ndetermine the formation of the branched product. See: Madrahimov,\\nS.
